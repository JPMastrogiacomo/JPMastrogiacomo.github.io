I am a Master's student in Atmospheric Physics at the University of Toronto. I have also completed an M.Math at the University of Waterloo and a B.Sc. at the University of Toronto.

I am a member of Professor Debra Wunch's research group. I am currently working to understand methane emissions from the Greater Toronto Area using TROPOMI data products. I gained an interest in the Earth's atmosphere and remote sensing as a research assistant at Environment and Climate Change Canada. I was helping Dr. Ray Nassar quantify CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power plants using NASA's OCO-2 and OCO-3 instruments. Please see our first paper published in Remote Sensing of Environment and a poster I made for IWGGMS-17.

I am broadly interested in the carbon cycle, inverse modelling, and remote sensing of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
