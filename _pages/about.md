I am a Doctoral student in Atmospheric Physics at the University of Toronto. I have also completed an MSc and BSc at the University of Toronto and an MMath at the University of Waterloo.

I joined Professor Debra Wunch's group in 2021 and my research focuses on estimating greenhouse gas enhancement ratios over urban areas using satellite data. I am currently developing new techniques for estimating enhancement ratios of CH<sub>4</sub> measured by TROPOMI. I also work with TROPOMI measurements of CO and NO<sub>2</sub>. I gained an interest in the Earth's atmosphere and remote sensing as a research assistant at Environment and Climate Change Canada. I was helping Dr. Ray Nassar quantify CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal-fired power plants using NASA's OCO-2 and OCO-3 instruments.

I am broadly interested in the carbon cycle, inverse modelling, and remote sensing of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
