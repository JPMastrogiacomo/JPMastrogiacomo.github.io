The two-dimensional problem of gravity-driven flow of a thin layer of fluid down a
porous inclined surface is discussed. A velocity profile based on the steady-state flow is
used to derive a first-order Integrated Boundary Layer model. A linear stability analysis is conducted while non-linear numerical simulations are used to validate the stability
predictions. The stability predictions of the first-order model are also compared directly
to those of a second-order model. The influence of porosity and other flow parameters is
investigated both analytically and numerically.
