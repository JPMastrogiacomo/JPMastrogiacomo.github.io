title: "Generalized IBL models for gravity-driven flow over inclined surfaces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-2
excerpt: 'In this investigation we propose several generalized first-order integral-boundary-layer (IBL) models to simulate the two-dimensional gravity-driven flow of a thin fluid layer down an incline. Various cases are considered and include: isothermal and non-isothermal flows, flat and wavy bottoms, porous and non-porous surfaces, constant and variable fluid properties, and Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. A numerical solution procedure is also proposed to solve the various model equations. Presented here are some results from our numerical experiments. To validate the generalized IBL models comparisons were made with existing results and the agreement was found to be reasonable.'
